If I were to implement a CI setup for a Java project I would probably end up using Maven or Gradle for specifying how the application is compiled and packaged. From source control point of view, I would use GIT and GitFlow workflow so that daily builds would be generated by pushing commits to development branch by any of the team members. Integrity of the development branch would be guaranteed by static analysis, unit tests and pull requests. Each pull request should be reviewed by at least one other team member. Also, it is also possible to come up with some pre-commit-hooks for team members to make basic sanity checks before accepting commits. Versions on development branch can be merged to release branch once all desired features are complete and possible manual testing has been done to release candidate builds.	

Regarding linting/static analysis, I would use SpotBugs or PMD which could be included as part of the script that builds the application. For unit tests I would go with JUnit which has been extensively used by Java developers all over the world. Jenkins has good plugins for Java projects but other online CI services could also include Circle CI, Drone.io or Travis. The decision whether to use self-hosted or an online CI would depend on following factors: is the software intended to be run on desktop or in cloud? Are there some regulations affecting the software that for security or privacy reasons require a self-hosted CI? Additionally, some special hardware requirements for creating builds (such as GPU) could affect the decision. For software that is desktop, regulated or hardware greedy self-hosted CI is preferred (or the only choice).
